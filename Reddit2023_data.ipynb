I am in MADS by UMich, which is not the most rigorous or prestigious, but it fits my goals, budget, and schedule. There are people who go through it and think that that is all they need to get a job. I kid you not someone had posted in our jobs slack channel giving advice that the program doesn't teach Tableau, pbi, or R, but that any job will teach you what you're missing. *This is true!* I was mediocre at R when I started my job and had no experience with pbi or the db system we use. Well this guy got hired on my team and quit after 4 days because he got in his own head about not being good enough. This was his very first corporate job and would have been a great opportunity had he stuck with it. If you feel overwhelmed, give it some time.

It was very difficult to make the switch, as far as finding someone to trust I could be a statistician and hire me.

But if you’re set on data science, I would try to get an internship before you’re out of school or at least try to increase industry skills in other ways. Look at job descriptions and make sure you’re tailoring your resume to hit what they’re looking for as well; it’ll need be very different from an academic CV.\n",
            "Happy to help out. I actually got a minor in CS during my time in undergrad as part of the program I was in. I was originally hired as a  technical QA/automated testing role. I got into the analytics work by volunteering for it, then subsequently doing a few trainings in my spare time.\n",
            "I used to be really passionate about math (was an olympiad qualifier, started taking graduate courses in my second year of college) and thought I would pursue a career in academia for a while until I fully internalized what that would look like. Took the offramp to industry right as I was finishing up. My PhD was fun but largely a waste of time in retrospect, and the opportunity cost was very high.\n",

            "One way to think about it is that at least 2 people on the team need to understand any technology/methodology that we want to use, or we can't appropriately review that work. And if you have overall responsibility for the project, you should understand it well enough to defend the decision to use it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another way to think about it is that the team is doing a lot of different types of work and all of that work has to be effective. It can basically never happen that the team was blocked for any serious amount of time because somebody didn't understand the tech well enough. Even if there are other so-called experts on it in the company, they're never going to care about your work as much as you do, and it's always going to go a lot faster if you can debug deeply yourself.\n",
            "Sure.  MBA is a mindset.  Many PMs are trained in that mindset too.  I also went to a MBA program that feeds a lot of people to McKinsey, BCG, etc, and tech is full of those types as well, so being able to communicate with them this is very valuable.\n",

Perception probably matters more than reality, but if I'm negotiating a promo grant I try to always do it being 100% prepared to walk away.   \\n\\nBig tech can be dumb about promotions.

I feel like when people start seriously job searching they'll usually figure out pretty quickly which option suits them. I've had a bit of luck with quant jobs as well, but those will typically not allow outside engagements because of stricter non competes.\\n\\nOne other thing I like about tech is that you're almost always working on something that interacts with users/customers, instead the highly abstracted concepts in trading. But you do get paid in cash in finance, and the upside can be much larger - $1 mil is a guy who ships a couple good strategies at an algo fund, but a lot has to go right to get to that number in tech, and almost never very quickly.\\n\\nCausal inference is a great skill to pitch - all the big tech firms will have a specific track (sometimes they call it experimentation, or decision science) for PhD grads.
